# Project description

The project is tool for planning of purchases.

- [ ] The application must provide an overview of food inventoryIngredient
- [ ] Have a cookbook with recipes
- [ ] Generate a shopping list based on the selected recipe in the cookbook as well as the current
  inventoryIngredient.
- [ ] The requirement specification described above is not final. Functionalities can be added and
  prioritized in dialogue with the customer and through feedback from user tests along the way.

# Agreement

- [ ] Each team is responsible for contacting and entering into an agreement with a person who can
  take the role and responsibility of end-user and customer (product owner).
  Technical requirements
- [ ] The application should be a desktop application for BDATA students. Use of Scene builders is
  allowed.
- [ ] Application data should be persisted into a relational database or a file system.
- [ ] Any usage of AI tools should be justified and documented both in Source code (with comments)
  and in report.
    - Specifically it must be described which AI tools are used, what they are used for, and why.

# Design requirements

- [ ] Universal Design – the application must be designed according to WCAG 2.1 principle 1 -
  Perceivable

# Process

Process The project should be carried out in 3 iterations. The results of the first two iterations
are presented in team meetings with subject teachers/learning assistants, while the results of the
last iteration are presented to subject teachers at the end of the semester as part of the
assessment in the subject. Overview of the three iterations:

- [ ] The first iteration has a focus on vision and requirements.
    - [ ] The team will develop an early prototype using wireframe.
    - [ ] User testing of the prototype must be carried out by users who are not part of the team.
    - [ ] The prototype is presented at the first guidance meeting with the subject teacher/learning
      assistant, in addition to the use- case diagram and domain model.
- [ ] The second iteration focuses on developing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using Java.
    - [ ] The application has just enough functionality needed to use it.
    - [ ] The application should at this stage be relatively error-free in contrast to the
      prototype.
    - [ ] Carry out user test 2 on MVP and present it at guidance meeting 2 with subject
      teacher/learning assistant.
        - [ ] You must also present the first version of requirements documentation and WIKI
- [ ] The third and final iteration focuses on finalizing the application according to the
  customer's and team's priorities.
    - [ ] All documentation, including attachments, must also be completed.
    - [ ] The team should have a standup meeting as agreed by the team
    - [ ] The team should have a status update (and feedback) meeting with a student assistant once
      a week.

# Basic information about the project

Your team is employed by a computer consulting company that has been commissioned to develop the new
information system. Notice that the team must create its own full-fledged system. As a student, you
will mainly play the role of a systems consultant designing and implementing the system. Lecturer
plays the role as a mentor in addition to expert advisors.

- Each team member has approx. 80 hours for her/his disposal ±10%.
- In the milestone plan, you will find deadlines for compulsory deliveries in different iterations.
- To ensure the quality of the application the team must continuously undertake unit testing using
  JUnit.
- To ensure high usability and a good user experience the application must relate to Don Norman’s
  principles of interaction design
- In order to evaluate the user experience the team must carry out usability tests after the first
  and second iteration (wireframe and MVP)
